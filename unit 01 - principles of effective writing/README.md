### 1. Introduction

What makes good writing?

- Good writing communicates an idea clearly and effectively. (***really important***)
  - Takes having something to say and clear thinking.
- Good writing is elegant and stylish. (***not so important***)
  - Takes time, revision, and a good editor.

What makes good writer?

- Having something to say.
- Logical thinking.
- A few simple, learnable rules of style.

Good writing can be learned.

In addition to taking a writing course, other things you can do to become a better writer:

- Read, pay attention, and imitate.
- write in a journal.
- Let go of "academic" writing habits.
- Talk about your research before trying to write about it.
- Write to engage your readers -- try not to bore them.
- Stop waiting for "inspiration".
- Accept that writing is hard for everyone.
- Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try.
- Learn how to cut ruthlessly. Never become too attached to your words.
- Find a good editor.
- Take risks.

### 2. Examples of What Not to Do

Ask Yourself:

- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

A classic hallmark of "academic writing": ***spunky verbs become clunky nouns***...

Example:

> "Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy is based on the ex vivo ***selection*** of tumor-reactive lymphocytes, and their activation and numerical ***expression*** before ***reinfusion*** to the autonomous tumor-bearing host."

From Ann Ku.

> "My professor friend told me that in his academic world, 'publish or perish' is really true. He doesn't care if nobody reads it or understands it as long as it's published."

### 3. Overview: Principles of Effective Writing

**Example**:

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of nouns instead of verbs. ***Verbs move sentences along, whereas nouns slow the reader down.***

> "***Dysregulation*** of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor ***initiation*** and ***progression***, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the ***expression*** of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of vague words.

> "Dysregulation of ***physiologic*** microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, ***molecular species*** that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of unnessary jargon and acronyms.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (***miR***) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including ***gliomagenesis***. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate ***miR*** activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature ***miRs*** may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of the passive voice.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity ***has been shown*** to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the distance between the subject and the main verb of this sentence.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, ***molecular species*** that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs ***may play*** equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Possible Rewrite**:

> "Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAs form binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer."

**Summary**:

- Cut unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with you words.
- User the active voice (subject-verb-object).
- Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb.
