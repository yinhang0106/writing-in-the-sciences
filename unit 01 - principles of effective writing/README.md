### 1. Introduction

What makes good writing?

- Good writing communicates an idea clearly and effectively. (***really important***)
  - Takes having something to say and clear thinking.
- Good writing is elegant and stylish. (***not so important***)
  - Takes time, revision, and a good editor.

What makes a good writer?

- Having something to say.
- Logical thinking.
- A few simple, learnable rules of style.

Good writing can be learned.

In addition to taking a writing course, other things you can do to become a better writer:

- Read, pay attention, and imitate.
- write in a journal.
- Let go of "academic" writing habits.
- Talk about your research before trying to write about it.
- Write to engage your readers -- try not to bore them.
- Stop waiting for "inspiration".
- Accept that writing is hard for everyone.
- Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try.
- Learn how to cut ruthlessly. Never become too attached to your words.
- Find a good editor.
- Take risks.

### 2. Examples of What Not to Do

Ask Yourself:

- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

A classic hallmark of "academic writing": ***spunky verbs become clunky nouns***...

Example:

> "Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy is based on the ex vivo ***selection*** of tumor-reactive lymphocytes, and their activation and numerical ***expression*** before ***reinfusion*** to the autonomous tumor-bearing host."

From Ann Ku.

> "My professor friend told me that in his academic world, 'publish or perish' is really true. He doesn't care if nobody reads it or understands it as long as it's published."

### 3. Overview: Principles of Effective Writing

**Example**:

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of nouns instead of verbs. ***Verbs move sentences along, whereas nouns slow the reader down.***

> "***Dysregulation*** of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor ***initiation*** and ***progression***, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the ***expression*** of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of vague words.

> "Dysregulation of ***physiologic*** microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, ***molecular species*** that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of unnecessary jargon and acronyms.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (***miR***) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including ***gliomagenesis***. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate ***miR*** activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature ***miRs*** may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the use of the passive voice.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity ***has been shown*** to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Note** the distance between the subject and the main verb of this sentence.

> "Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, ***molecular species*** that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs ***may play*** equally relevant roles in cancer."

**Possible Rewrite**:

> "Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAs form binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer."

**Summary**:

- Cut unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words.
- User the active voice (subject-verb-object).
- Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb.

### 4. Cut the Clutter

On writing well, William Zinsser:

"The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what -- these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank."

Example #1:

> "This paper provides an review of the basic tenets of cancer biology study design, using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or that demonstrate the successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biologic research."

Rewrite:

> "This paper reviews the basic tenets of cancer biology study design, using examples to illustrate challenges and solutions."

Example #2:

> "As it is well known, increase athletic activity has been related to a profile of lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure levels, and improved muscular and cardio-respiratory performance."

rewrites:

> "Increased athletic activity is associated with lower cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, and improved fitness."

Better:

> "Increased athletic activity lowers cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, and improves fitness. (stronger level of evidence)"

Example #3:

> "THe experimental demonstration is the first of its kind and is a proof of principle for the concept of laser driven particle acceleration in a structure loaded vacuum."

Rewrite:

> "The experiment provides the first proof of principle for laser-driven particle acceleration in a structure-loaded vacuum."

Example #4:

> "Brain injury incidence shows two peak periods in almost all reports: rates are the highest in young people and the elderly."

Rewrite:

> "Brain injury incidence peaks in the young and the elderly."

Common clutter:

1. Dead weight words.

   - As it is well known
   - As it has been shown
   - It can be regarded as
   - It should be emphasized that

2. Empty words.

   - basic tenets
   - methodologic
   - important

3. Long words that could be short.

   - muscular and cardio-respiratory performance

4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms.

   - Gliomagenesis
   - miR

5. Repetitive words.

   - studies/examples
   - illustrate/demonstrate
   - challenges/difficulties
   - successful solutions/solutions

6. Adverbs
  
   - very, really, quite, rather, somewhat, pretty, fairly, actually, basically, essentially, virtually, clearly, obviously, naturally, definitely, positively, absolutely, seriously, and importantly, etc.
